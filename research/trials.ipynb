How Much Do the \\nVehicles Cost? \\nEVs are generally more expensive than \\ntheir conventional counterparts. However, lower fueling and maintenance costs can make them a competitive option. For example, electric drivetrains are more efficient, making BEVs (and PHEVs operating in electric mode) more than three times as efficient. Electricity is also less expensive than gasoline or diesel on an energy-equivalent basis. BEV drivers can save as much as $14,500 in fuel costs alone over 15 years (see table: Benefits \\nof Electric-Drive Vehicles). Federal and state tax credits and private and utility rebates may also be available to help offset the cost of EVs.

All-electric vehicles produce zero tailpipe emissions, and PHEVs produce no tailpipe emissions when in electric-only mode. \\nLife cycle emissions are generated when \\nfuel or electricity is produced, as well as during the manufacturing of the vehicle itself. The life cycle emissions of an EV largely depend on how the electricity is generated (and how much a PHEV’s engine is being used), and this varies by region. Generally, all-electric vehicles and PHEVs produce one-third to half the emissions of conventional vehicles, respectively, considering both air pollutants and greenhouse gases. Regions with high use of renewable energy will see stronger emissions benefits. See a comparison of emissions by state using the AFDC emissions tool at afdc.energy. gov/ev-emissions.html . \\nWhat About Safety and \\nMaintenance? \\nAll EVs undergo the same rigorous \\nsafety testing as conventional vehicles sold in the United States and must meet Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (including those for batteries). For additional safety information, refer to the AFDC’s Maintenance and Safety of Hybrid and Plug-In Electric Vehicles page (afdc.energy.gov/vehicles/electric_ maintenance.html ). \\nBecause PHEVs have conventional engines, their maintenance requirements are similar to conventional vehicles. \\n3 '),\n",

A manufacturer’s warranty of a battery typically covers 8 years or 100,000 miles, and the expected battery lifetime is 12 to 15 years under normal operating conditions and in moderate climates. Check with your manufacturer about vehicle and battery warranties.

For information on available vehicle incentives, see the AFDC Laws & Incentives page ( afdc.energy.gov/laws). \\nTo find fuel economy ratings and fuel/ vehicle cost comparisons among currently available models, visit FuelEconomy.gov . \\nHow Do Their Emissions \\nCompare With Those of Conventional Vehicles? \\nEVs typically produce fewer emissions \\nthan conventional vehicles. All-electric vehicles produce zero tailpipe emissions, and PHEVs produce no tailpipe emissions when in electric-only mode. \\nLife cycle emissions are generated when \\nfuel or electricity is produced, as well as during the manufacturing of the vehicle itself. The life cycle emissions of an EV largely depend on how the electricity is generated (and how much a PHEV’s engine is being used), and this varies by region. Generally, all-electric vehicles and PHEVs produce one-third to half the emissions of conventional vehicles, respectively, considering both air pollutants and greenhouse gases. Regions with high use of renewable energy will see stronger emissions benefits. See a comparison of emissions by state using the AFDC emissions tool at afdc.energy. gov/ev-emissions.html . \\nWhat About Safety and \\nMaintenance? \\nAll EVs undergo the same rigorous \\nsafety testing as conventional vehicles sold in the United States and must meet Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (including those for batteries). For additional safety information, refer to the AFDC’s Maintenance and Safety of Hybrid and Plug-In Electric Vehicles page (afdc.energy.gov/vehicles/electric_ maintenance.html ). \\nBecause PHEVs have conventional engines, their maintenance requirements are similar to conventional vehicles. \\n3 PHEVs Beneÿts of \\nElectric-Drive \\nVehicles compared \\nto conventional vehicles \\nFuel Economy All-electric vehicles \\nMost achieve combined fuel \\neconomy ratings higher than \\n90 mpge .* \\nEmissions \\nReductions Produce no tailpipe emissions \\nwhen in electric-only mode. \\nGenerally, they produce less than \\nhalf the emissions .

A manufacturer’s warranty of a battery typically covers 8 years or 100,000 miles, and the expected battery lifetime is 12 to 15 years under normal operating conditions and in moderate climates. Check with your manufacturer about vehicle and battery warranties. Brake systems on these vehicles typically last longer than conventional vehicles because regenerative braking reduces brake wear. \\nAll-electric vehicles lack conventional \\nengines and have far fewer moving parts and fewer fluids to change, so they typically require less maintenance than conventional vehicles or even PHEVs.

How Much Do the \\nVehicles Cost? \\nEVs are generally more expensive than \\ntheir conventional counterparts. However, lower fueling and maintenance costs can make them a competitive option. For example, electric drivetrains are more efficient, making BEVs (and PHEVs operating in electric mode) more than three times as efficient. Electricity is also less expensive than gasoline or diesel on an energy-equivalent basis. BEV drivers can save as much as $14,500 in fuel costs alone over 15 years (see table: Benefits \\nof Electric-Drive Vehicles). Federal and state tax credits and private and utility rebates may also be available to help offset the cost of EVs.

The life cycle emissions of an EV largely depend on how the electricity is generated (and how much a PHEV’s engine is being used), and this varies by region. Generally, all-electric vehicles and PHEVs produce one-third to half the emissions of conventional vehicles, respectively, considering both air pollutants and greenhouse gases. Regions with high use of renewable energy will see stronger emissions benefits.

EVs include all-electric vehicles, also referred to as battery electric vehicles (BEVs), and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). In colloquial references, these vehicles are called electric cars, or simply EVs, even though some of these vehicles still use liquid fuels in conjunction with electricity. EVs are known for providing instant torque and a quiet driver experience. \\nOther types of electric-drive vehicles \\nnot covered here include hybrid electric vehicles, which are powered by a conventional engine and an electric motor that uses energy stored in a battery that is charged by regenerative braking, not by plugging in, and fuel cell electric vehicles, which use a propulsion system similar to electric vehicles, where energy stored as hydrogen is converted to electricity by the fuel cell. \\nAll-Electric Vehicles \\nAll-electric vehicles do not have \\nconventional engines but are driven solely by one or more electric motors powered by energy stored in batteries. The batteries are charged by plugging the vehicle into \\nNational Highway Travel Survey, U.S. Department \\nof Transportation, Federal Highway Administration, 2008, fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/pubs/pl08021/ fig4_5.cfm . \\nElectric vehicles are charged by plugging the vehicle into an electric power source. \\nPhoto courtesy of Forth. \\nan electric power source and can also be \\ncharged through regenerative braking. All-electric vehicles produce no tailpipe emissions, although there are “life cycle” emissions associated with the electricity production. \\nAll-electric vehicles typically have \\nshorter driving ranges per charge than conventional vehicles have per tank of gasoline. Most new BEVs are designed to travel between 110 and over 300 miles on a fully charged battery, depending on the model. For context, 90% of all U.S. household trips cover less than 100 miles.\\n1 An all-electric vehicle’s range \\nvaries according to driving conditions and driving habits. Extreme temperatures tend to reduce range because energy from the battery powers climate control systems in addition to powering the motor. Speeding, aggressive driving, and heavy loads can also reduce range. Regenerative Braking \\nRegenerative braking allows EVs to \\ncapture energy normally lost during braking by using the electric motor as a generator and storing that captured energy in the battery. \\nPlug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles \\nPHEVs use batteries to power an electric \\nmotor and use another fuel, such as gasoline, to power a conventional engine. The batteries are typically charged by plugging the PHEV into an electric power source, although they can also be charged by the conventional engine and through regenerative braking. \\nPHEVs have an all-electric driving range \\nof about 15 to 60+ miles, depending on the model. As long as the battery is \\nEVs at a Glance \\nEVs run on electricity alone. They are powered by one or more \\nelectric motors and a battery. The battery is charged by plugging \\nthe vehicle into an electric power source and through regenerative braking. \\nPHEVs  can travel moderate distances on electricity alone. \\nThe battery can be charged by plugging into an electric power source, through regenerative braking, and by the engine. \\nPHEVs don’t have to be plugged in before driving. They can also be fueled solely with conventional fuel. However, they will not achieve maximum fuel economy or take full advantage of their all-electric capabilities without plugging in. 1 Getting started with an EV is easy \\nthanks to the charging “cordset” that comes with most vehicles. \\nPhoto by \\nErik Nelsen, NREL 64277. 2 fhwa.dot.gov/environment/alternative_fuel_corridors \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n  charged, a PHEV can draw most of its \\npower from electricity for typical daily driving. The engine will then power on when the battery is mostly depleted, during rapid acceleration, at high speeds, or when intensive heating or air conditioning is required. \\nWhen running on battery power alone, \\nPHEVs produce no tailpipe emissions. Even when the conventional engine is running, PHEVs typically consume less gasoline and produce fewer emissions than similar conventional vehicles. \\nWhat EV Models Are \\nAvailable? \\nNearly all major vehicle manufacturers \\nhave EV models available, and some have committed to transitioning to selling only EVs by 2030. \\nMedium- and heavy-duty options are \\nalso available for fleet applications.

The charging unit communicates with the vehicle to ensure that it supplies an appropriate and safe flow of electricity. \\nThere are more than 140,000 publicly \\navailable charging outlets—and counting—across the country. Most currently available light-duty BEVs have ranges between 110 and over 300 miles. Technological advances such as larger batteries and growing access to charging are increasingly addressing “range anxiety,” or the fear of running out of charge. Learn more about trends in EV charging infrastructure ( afdc.energy.gov/ \\nfuels/electricity_infrastructure_trends. html). \\nIt may take as little as 30 minutes to fully charge an EV’s battery, but charging times vary based on the type or level of charging; the type of battery, its capacity, and how depleted it is; and the capacity of the vehicle’s internal charger (see Charging Options table). \\nCharging units can be installed in \\nresidential, fleet, workplace, and public settings. Most EVs come with a 110-volt “Level 1” cordset that can be plugged into a typical electrical outlet. For quicker charging, homeowners can install a 240-V “Level 2” unit on a dedicated electrical circuit. This can often be done with little or no required electrical upgrades, as most homes have 240-V service for appliances like dryers and electric ranges. A Level 2 unit can be portable or “hard wired” into a building and can be purchased for as little as $200. For more information on installing charging equipment, see Charging Infrastructure Procurement and Installation on the AFDC (afdc.energy. gov/fuels/electricity_infrastructure_ development.html ). \\nTo make long-distance travel more accessible, the Federal Highway Administration is establishing a network of alternative fueling and charging infrastructure along highway corridors.

To find public stations, use the Alternative Fueling Station Locator ( afdc.energy.gov/ \\nstations), which is available as an iPhone and Android app. \\nEquipment Types and Costs \\nCharging units are classified according to the rate at which they charge batteries.

      "Electric vehicles (EVs) use electricity \n",
      "as their primary fuel or to improve the effciency of conventional vehicle designs. EVs include all-electric vehicles, also referred to as battery electric vehicles (BEVs), and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). In colloquial references, these vehicles are called electric cars, or simply EVs, even though some of these vehicles still use liquid fuels in conjunction with electricity. EVs are known for providing instant torque and a quiet driver experience. \n",
      "Other types of electric-drive vehicles \n",
      "not covered here include hybrid electric vehicles, which are powered by a conventional engine and an electric motor that uses energy stored in a battery that is charged by regenerative braking, not by plugging in, and fuel cell electric vehicles, which use a propulsion system similar to electric vehicles, where energy stored as hydrogen is converted to electricity by the fuel cell. \n",

      "shorter driving ranges per charge than conventional vehicles have per tank of gasoline. Most new BEVs are designed to travel between 110 and over 300 miles on a fully charged battery, depending on the model. For context, 90% of all U.S. household trips cover less than 100 miles.\n",
      "1 An all-electric vehicle’s range \n",
      "varies according to driving conditions and driving habits. Extreme temperatures tend to reduce range because energy from the battery powers climate control systems in addition to powering the motor. Speeding, aggressive driving, and heavy loads can also reduce range. Regenerative Braking \n",

      "It may take as little as 30 minutes to fully charge an EV’s battery, but charging times vary based on the type or level of charging; the type of battery, its capacity, and how depleted it is; and the capacity of the vehicle’s internal charger (see Charging Options table). \n",
      "Charging units can be installed in \n",
      "residential, fleet, workplace, and public settings. Most EVs come with a 110-volt “Level 1” cordset that can be plugged into a typical electrical outlet. For quicker charging, homeowners can install a 240-V “Level 2” unit on a dedicated electrical circuit. This can often be done with little or no required electrical upgrades, as most homes have 240-V service for appliances like dryers and electric ranges. A Level 2 unit can be portable or “hard wired” into a building and can be purchased for as little as $200.

      "Answer:  Electric vehicles generally have a higher purchase price than conventional vehicles. However, lower fueling and maintenance costs can make them a competitive option. For example, electric drivetrains are more efficient, making BEVs (and PHEVs operating in electric mode) more than three times as efficient. Electricity is also less expensive than gasoline or diesel on an energy-equivalent basis. BEV drivers can save as much as $14,500 in fuel costs alone over 15 years. Federal and state tax credits and private and utility rebates may also be available to help offset the cost of EVs.\n",

      "Answer:  Electric vehicles typically produce fewer emissions than conventional vehicles. All-electric vehicles produce zero tailpipe emissions, and PHEVs produce no tailpipe emissions when in electric-only mode. Life cycle emissions are generated when fuel or electricity is produced, as well as during the manufacturing of the vehicle itself. The life cycle emissions of an EV largely depend on how the electricity is generated (and how much a PHEV's engine is being used), and this varies by region. Generally, all-electric vehicles and PHEVs produce one-third to half the emissions of conventional vehicles, respectively, considering both air pollutants and greenhouse gases. Regions with high use of renewable energy will see stronger emissions benefits.\n",
